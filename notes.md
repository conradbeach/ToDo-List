Refactor the first nav section and the main content list to be 2 element <li>s. The setup right now where each element is it's own <li> probably isn't as semantic.

At lower widths (less than 500px), the main content gets squished and terrible when you pop out the nav menu.
At those lower widths, adjust the width of the nav.

In Firefox, the numbers inside the circles are too high.
